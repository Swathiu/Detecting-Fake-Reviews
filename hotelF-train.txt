ID-1179	The price of the stay is no where near the crappy service given to the customers. I couldn't find a decent informant throughout my entire stay. I wouldn't recommend this hotel. The purpose of a hotel is to make your trip comfortable- so you don't end up sleeping in a dump- and while this is no dump, it is not what you would expect from a Marriott hotel! I was overcharged for everything! The mattresses were uncomfortable and wi-fi was not free [come on, what hotel doesn't have free wi-fi?]. I would suggest that you look elsewhere if you're planning a trip to Washington!
ID-0968	The Crowne Plaza near the Pittsburgh, PA airport met our expectations. The room was decent in size, we felt secure there, and the hotel included a pool area, restaurant, and sports bar. TV station selection was good, and the staff was friendly and helpful.
ID-1261	One word: overpriced. the most beautiful parts of the hotel were only in the pictures. they did not show the small, cramped and dirty rooms or the disgusting hallways. The staff barely spoke english and I often had an impossibly hard time discussing what I wanted to these people. Pool bar and other hotel food was very poor and also got a bad resteraunt review from the consierge.
ID-0950	Great Hotel  When me and my husband first walked in the hotel we were greeted and immediately serviced. Even with the cheap prices, the rooms very clean and it was a great place to stay. The free continental breakfast was very good and the servicing of the hotel was amazing. Two thumbs up and I would recommend this place to anyone!
ID-0910	I arrived at Terranea in need of relaxation. The property was just as beautiful as it was in the pictures. The front desk staff was very attentive and offered us champagne while we waited. My room had an amazing view and I barely wanted to leave it. There were several restaurants to choose from so we tried one each for lunch and dinner during our stay and every meal was delicious. The pools were heated and I stayed as long as I could at night. The weekend was perfect and I seriously can't wait to return!
ID-0908	When my husband and I arrived at the St. Louis Super 8 we were so relieved to find a safe place to stay with our dogs. The manager was very accommodating and showed us to a clean room in a newly remodeled wing of the motel. We had a great night's sleep knowing our dogs were safe with us.
ID-0876	This hotel was super affordable and even had a pool, which was great. The bed was very comfortable and I slept really well on it. The TV also worked great and had a ton of channels. The hotel is in a great area with lots of places to eat nearby. I would definitely stay there again!
ID-1145	The XV Beacon is an overrated full of itself hotel in snobby in the Beacon Hill neighborhood ofBoston. The rooms are atrociously small and really only suited for one guest. When traveling with a companion it is a very cramped stay. the hotel has seen better days. There are chips in the furniture and worn carpets in the halls. Many of the rooms look directly into office buildings and the window shades therefore are pulled up from the bottom rather than down from the top for privacy. this means that light only comes in from the top of the windows and gives the rooms a cave like feeling. One of the worst things about the hotel is the location. There is nothing in the immediate area as it's mostly residential. Going out at night requires a drive to get anywhere and the valet parking service is slow. There are much better choices of hotels in Boston that provide spacious rooms and n ideal location.
ID-1012	This hotel is located in the heart of the city, right off the exit. In walking distance to new shops and stores. A waffle house restaurant is attached to hotel that is open 24/7. Also a 24 hour gas station. Rooms come equipped with refrigerator and microwave.
ID-1010	The room we reserved was as described on the website. All the listed amentities were included. The furnishings were comfortable, updated and in good condition. The beds were comfortable and the linens luxurious. The hotel was in a prime location for local attractions and appeared to be safe. The location was quiet and quaint. The concierge was very helpful with any questions we had and the hotel staff was friendly.
ID-0828	Exciting, one-stop resort for the perfect vacation!  Our weekend getaway at the Hilton Hawaiian Village was fantastic! Our room was beautiful and we met so many nice people also on vacation.   The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a shoppers dream! The first day I shopped 'til I dropped while the boys checked out the famous Diamond Head beach close by. Hilton Hawaiian Village has it all--bars, lounges, a spa, tons of shopping, convenience stores, restaurants, pools, and so much more! We never even had to travel more than 5 minutes!
ID-1221	I recently visited Las Vegas for work function and stayed at the Flamingo Hotel and was extremely underwhelmed with my experience. My first negative for the hotel was experienced as soon as I walked in the door! The smoke smell was overwhelming and it was very obvious that this hotel is quite old. I went on to check in and stood in line for twenty minutes only to be told that my room was not ready! This would be understandable if I had arrived prior to check in time, but I arrived at 7:00 PM! I was extremely upset and told that there was nothing they could do! I was forced to meander around the casino for another forty-five minutes until my room was ready.  After getting to my room, I was even more upset! It did not appear to have been very well kept. There were stains on the carpets, hair on the bathroom floor, and it smelled very musky. I asked for a non-smoking room but it was very obvious that this room had been smoked in. I called the front desk to complain and was told that they could try to get me in a different room tomorrow, but that there were no other room available tonight. Since I was forced to stay in this room at least for the night, I decided to head down to get some food. I ate at Margaritaville and was not pleased with the loud music and the repetitive show that I had to endure while there. The food was ok, but seemed to be overpriced for what I got.  I made the best of my night and was told the next day that they would not be able to relocate me to a better room. I still had plans of being in Vegas for another 3 nights and did not want to deal with this stench! I decided to go across the street to Caesars Palace and got right in to an updated, smoke free room. I do not plan to ever return to the Flamingo Las Vegas. You get what you pay for at this hotel. Low price, low class.
ID-0900	The hotel is not as tidy as it should be but it has changed since the last time i have been there because i had so many more negative comments about this specific hotel.
ID-1219	We stayed at the Cannery Pier Hotel a few months ago, and I have to say, we were sorely disappointed... After all the reviews we'd read online, all the beautiful pictures, we may just have gotten our hopes up too high, but it really wasn't what we were expecting.  Admittedly, it's a cute, kind of quaint little hotel. It looks beautiful, sitting out on an old pier over the Columbia River. Unfortunately, after seeing the condition of the pilings for the old piers immediately adjacent to the hotel, we had to hope that our room was on a high enough floor to stay above water if some kind of disaster struck.  We stayed in one of the One Bedroom Suites, and while it was a very nice room, I would have thought that for how much they charged it'd be a little bigger at least. It wasn't cramped, but definitely smaller than we expected. And as much as I hate to nitpick, the mattress on the bed felt cheap, with springs that turned into nothing but pressure points when you climbed into the bed.   The jetted tub was a nice touch, and was certainly cozy. But a window directly adjacent to the tub left it a little lacking in privacy, especially since there was another hotel that directly faced the corner our room was on, and it took us a bit of fiddling to figure out how to raise the privacy blinds (yes, it came *up* from the windowsill) in order to really be able to relax and not worry that someone in the hotel across the way had a pair of binoculars pointed our way.  While some people may enjoy the complimentary wine and lox they serve in the evenings, someone like me who has a severe seafood allergy has to avoid the whole lobby area during that time because coming into any contact with fish (of any kind) will end up sending me to the hospital.   Many people I've talked to simply raved about how cool it was that they had these old towncars to chauffeur you to your restaurant for dinner. Well, the one time we took a ride in the Buick they had there, we both developed such horrible headaches from the exhaust fumes from some kind of leak (seriously, don't they know that carbon monoxide is toxic???) that we had to ride the whole way there with the windows rolled down. In the summer that may not be such a bad thing, but in the winter, when it's raining? Thankfully our restaurant was very near the hotel, but by the time we got there, we were both freezing. We didn't take the towncar back, but rather called for a taxi. Imagine that, we were warm and dry and didn't get a headache!  Overall, it's a very cute hotel, and they're definitely trying, but there's definitely room for improvement.
ID-0798	This is a beautiful hotel. The high ceilings and ambiance make you feel welcome as soon as you arrive. The front desk is friendly and greet you with a smile on their face. The room was nicely sized and had 2 TV's - one in the bedroom and one in the open area. The bathroom had a nice jacuzzi tub and this is just what I needed after a long and fun day of walking around New Orleans. The free evening snacks were also a nice surprise! It even came with free soda! We took a plate up to our room and watched a movie. The free breakfast was also excellent. Both of my children made waffles in the waffle maker, which they were very excited about. It was great to start the day off with a nice fresh meal. We will definitely be staying here again.
ID-1175	After staying at other similar resorts, I have found this hotel to be quite disappointing. Booking a room was a hassle, not to mention dealing with the hotel security. When I arrived at the hotel, I was informed that there were no rooms available! I was outrageous and furious, especially since I had booked two weeks in advanced. I had to wait 4 hours until the cleaning staff finished a room I didn't even ask for. Even worse, I walk into my hotel room and discover the smell of cigarettes! I have severe asthma and I could not tolerate the stench. Even though this room was a designated non-smoking room, the hotel staff refused to switch my room or refund my money. Never again will I come here again!
ID-1034	Palm Grove Hotel is a family hotel which offers affordable ocean front luxury in the heart of Virginia Beach. We are minutes away from golf, tennis and shopping. Or you can stay right here for an afternoon of fun. Whether you want to walk out of your hotel room onto the white sands of the beach, or relax in our private pool, we are your Virginia Beach destination for relaxation and fun. Come let our friendly staff help you enjoy your next Virginia Beach getaway.
ID-1014	This hotel was very accomodating for my needs. It had easy access and was in an area of high volume so it was not difficult to find places to eat meals. Each room offered a binder of different things to do around the area so that was very helpful. Also, there were no issues with items we needed and the noise level. It was a very quiet place to stay.
ID-1161	The Inn at Northrup Station is a tiny, hole in the wall hotel that leaves a lot to be desired. The hotel decorations were wild to say the least. If you are anything like Elton John in the 70's, this is right up your alley. The rooms are a little overpriced for what they actually offer. The service is slow, I assume because of the small size of the hotel, and in turn, the staff.
ID-1085	Afternoon Tea at The Peninsula was a fabulous experience. The service was everything you would expect from a 5-star hotel, the sweet and savory little treats were exquisite and the caramel pear tea was flavorful and perfectly soothing. Loved every moment of it!  The Belvedere Restaurant was also perfect in every way! I dined at this restaurant for my birthday. The surroundings: opulent, the food: top quality, and most of all the staff made me feel very special.
ID-1024	This motel was located right across from the beach, and was extremely clean and was well kept up. The newer building was extremely nice and was a very good deal for a beachfront motel. This motel provided me with all I needed from a motel and I enjoyed my stay a lot.
ID-0974	This hotel is conveniently located in the heart of downtown San Francisco. It is located withing walking distance to major attractions. All rooms are designed in a contemporary style that will suit the highest tastes.
ID-0956	I arrived to a very friendly staff and a surprisingly spacious and clean room. The location was very convenient, only a short drive to downtown and the awesome South Congress night life. The rooms have all your standard amenities and FREE WIFI!!!  I took advantage of the FREE continental breakfast every morning and saved some $$$. The cost of this hotel was better than any in town, and I am a very happy customer.   I would strongly recommend this hotel and WILL be staying here again! Thanks Days Inn!
ID-0840	We checked in to the Doubletree Suites in Melbourne FL 3 days after Christmas and our stay was wonderful. We were greeted at the front desk with warm chocolate chip cookies fresh out of the oven. The room was clean and comfortable and the king sized bed was a real treat. It was also nice that they kept the holiday music playing in the lobby and at the pool throughout our stay even though Christmas had passed. The pool was heated, the beach was beautiful. We found the staff to be friendly and open to our requests. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wanted to vacation at an upscale hotel.
ID-1061	Every time the AC kicked on in my room there was a loud high-pitched whine. It was very distracting and I could not sleep. I called the front desk and they said they'd have someone check on it shortly. An hour later, no one had been to my room. I called again and they told me that there was no one from maintenance available until the morning. I didn't sleep but after some investigation, I determined the high-pitched noise was caused by the adjoining room doors. I opened mine to stop the suction being caused by the AC but didn't sleep soundly since I felt unsafe with the door being opened not knowing who was on the other side of the door. I came back next evening to find the door closed but the problem had not been resolved. I called the front desk and was told that maintance could find no problem. I asked to be moved but was told there were no available rooms. I explained the fix for the problem and they suggested I again leave my door open. I will not stay at this hotel again nor recommend to friends.
ID-0834	My family’s recent vacation stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites in Modesto, California was absolutely wonderful! The rooms were updated, well kept, and extremely clean. Not to mention, the pillow-top beds are the most comfortable we have ever slept in! As a matter of fact, I asked the gal at the front desk to supply the manufacturer of the beds so we can order one for our own home! The continental breakfast each morning was plentiful, varied, and delicious! From waffles and biscuits and gravy to fresh fruit and pastries, my family had a more than sufficient meal to start each day out right. We always stay at Hampton Inn’s because of the great quality and reputation they offer. We cannot wait to come back!
ID-0922	The Dillon Inn is a great place to stay if you want inexpensive lodging near the mountains. We are 15 to 30 minutes away from Breckenridge, Keystone, and Arapahoe Basin. Vail is only about 45 minutes away. The hotel has nice rooms, hot tub accessibility, and a shuttle to Keystone in the morning.
ID-1233	The Kalahari Resort was not a very good vacation. I was disappointed with the cheesy decor and the mediocre rooms. The water park was exciting, but it was too crowded to have any fun. The food was sub par for the price that they were asking. If I had to do it again, I would stay in a less expensive hotel in the dells.
ID-1093	Oxnard Inn looks like a prostitute hotel. The linen are old and rugged and the front desk staff does not have a clear sign of check in and check out posted. If there is any problem, the staff will argue with you before they listen to the problem and try to work it out. If you stay too long, the people in the town wonder if you are a prostitute because of your shabby housing. I was just looking for a good hotel deal.
ID-0862	I was so happy to drive up to the Hampton Inn in Manhattan, Kansas after a long drive from Conway, Arkansas! The parking lot and lobby entrance were well-lit and clean, and the staff member that checked me was incredibly helpful. He went above and beyond to accommodate my many requests (allergies = no down-filled pillows!), which I very much appreciated. My room was conveniently located on the first floor, where I had easy access to their gym and pool, and I was only steps away from the complimentary coffee and tea station! The room was cozy and charmingly decorated, which made me feel right at home. The free continental breakfast was fantastic, and included many healthy options as well as more traditional breakfast choices. I didn't travel with kids, but I can imagine that this hotel would be a good choice for parents because the pool was indoor and heated, and the dining area contained 2 large flat screen televisions with access to the remote! I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit the Manhattan, KS area. Go Cats!
ID-0850	The Circus Circus hotel in Reno, Nevada is an amazing hotel that I would recommend to anyone. The rates are great and the slots are loose. They have amazing deals, especially if you are willing to go during the week instead of the weekend. There are multiple restaurants to choose from, so any appetite can be satisfied. There is a ton of parking and it is right in the middle of everything you could possibly want to do in Reno. Also, there is a Cabellas not too far away for something fun to do during the day after a long night of winning at gambling!
ID-1181	Worst. Hotel. EVER. The staff were really rude and nasty. My room had stained sheets and there were no towels. I had to ask the manager three times for towels and an extra blanket. To make matters worse the television would not turn on and the microwave looked like it was one of the very first models ever made. Then in the middle of the night I was awakened by the couple next door, who were shouting at each other. I'm glad, though, because a very large cockroach was crawling over the blanket.
ID-1111	I Think My Overall stay at great wolf lodge was terrible, the food was very overpriced. the arcade was very overpriced. The water slides weren't very impressive, compared the the wilderness lodge in wisconsin dells, which has 5 water parks. The lines were all too long, i spent most of the day in line. There are always obnoxious drunk people crowding the hot tub and poorly supervising their children. the life guards seemed to be on their phones most of the time and not really paying attention to any of the kids. there is always nasty things floating in the wave pool. my experience was terrible and i will never go back.
ID-1032	I chose this place because it seemed economical. The room was clean, internet and tv were okay. For the money, it was a good decision. The location was nice because it was close to shopping and restaurants. I would recommend it.
ID-0918	Super 8 really is a super hotel. The last time I was there, service was quick, responsive and was an overall joy to be around. Anything I needed (examples: a spare cot, some towels, etc.) they had brought to my room within a minute. The facilities themselves were fantastic and were five star quality. A fantastic hotel chain that really has the customer in mind.
ID-0878	I just adored staying in this hotel. I inquired at the front desk, and the helpful employee told me that the structure was only six years old. You can tell! Everything is so new and well-kept-up-with. There is even a fabulous restaurant downstairs! We were so glad to see that we would not have to eat the typical continental breakfast in the morning, but would instead get a nice hot meal. They were even upgrading the indoor pool when we visited with a water feature, so we will be sure to visit again to check on its progress!
ID-1043	The Southernmost Hotel in Key West was a true disappointment. We reserved an ocean-view room. When we got there, the only room they had available was one overlooking the parking lot. The linens were dirty. The pool was closed the entire time for maintenance. The staff couldn't have been ruder - not only did they ignore us for almost 30 minutes upon arrival but they refused to compensate us at all for the huge downgrade of our room.
ID-1239	Worst place I've ever stayed. We booked the room a few days prior to arrival but when we got there to check in they had given our room to someone else. They then said they were going to upgrade our room. The upgraded room was on the bottom floor with a car parked right in front of the door and we could barely get in the door. But even worse, the room had not been cleaned. There was trash and food everywhere and the bed was a mess.  They didn't even offer a discount or anything when we complained and asked for a clean room.   The walls are paper thin. You can hear everything in the next room and the noise from the shops on the other side.
ID-1119	We had to stay at The Oread for a work conference. I have to say that I felt like I was staying in a dungeon. It was dark and scary in some of those hallways. The staff that checked us in did not seem to care about doing a good job, they did not point us in the right direction to find our rooms, so we wandered around the dark hotel aimlessly, accidentally walking in on meetings and special meals that other guests were having. When we finally made it up to the room, there was still a dirty towel from the previous people who stayed laying on the bathroom floor, so I am sure the place had not be cleaned well. I would not stay here again.
ID-0960	We had a wonderful time at the Luxor hotel and casino during a recent trip to Las Vegas. The rooms were large, clean, and newly remodeled. Huge tub and shower! We had an excellent view of the strip. Service was prompt and courteous, they made us feel at home. The food at the restaurants and buffets was delicious and fairly priced. We would definitely recommend the hotel to friends and family.
ID-0820	We got stuck in Orlando Florida and the airline put us up in a Best Western. By the time we got to the hotel it was 2am, we were tired and cranky, but the receptionist made us feel welcome and got us checked in and in our room very quickly. The room was pleasant, clean and we got a great night sleep. Because we had a late check out we were able to sleep in, get ready for the rest of our trip without rush and then head on down for something to eat.
ID-1035	The Westin in St. Louis is located in the center of St. Louis. The hotel was dingy and you can easily get lost in the hotel. The halls are a maze. The rooms were ugly and dirty.
ID-1151	The W Hotel in San Francisco is seen as a posh and trendy hotel, but it does have its drawbacks. The price of the hotel is highly expensive and can be unfordable to the average travelers. The hallways are dark and unusual. Some people might refer to it as art but many people think of it as unusual and strange. Due to the location downtown, parking is very expensive and the one way streets of San Francisco can be horrendous for the new visitor. The W hotel does boast of an indoor pool, but it is rather small and only holds depths of up to 6 ft. If your looking to visit San Francisco there are many other great alternatives to stay at.
ID-0930	My first thoughts upon arrival of this hotel were very pleasing; The exterior was beautiful, and it was very calm. The hotel lobby was also very inviting, and I was greeted with welcoming messages from the staff. When I went to my room, everything there was neat and clean, unlike many hotels I have visited. You can certainly tell that the maids are hard-working. Everything ran smoothly with this visit; the booking process on their website was extremely easy, and check-out went quickly. All in all, I can say that this was an enjoyable experience, and I will be visiting again the next time I come to stay in the area. Thanks!
ID-0916	Amazing! Wonderful service and clean rooms. The clerk was very friendly and made our stay very pleasant. The breakfast was also great. It seemed like eating homemade breakfast my Mom used to make every morning. Very warm and inviting. I plan on coming again next year!
ID-0990	Aston Waikiki Circle is a perfect location for a great Hawaiian Vacation. Walking into the underwater themed lobby, you are welcomed with ALOHA from the great staff. The panoramic view from the penthouse balcony, is a perfect setting for watching the sunset and romantic dinners. Located in Waikiki Beach, it is walking distance to the best restaurants and clubs Oahu has to offer. Steps from the sand, it is an excellent place to unwind and relax or surf in the warm waters of Hawaii.
ID-0848	While in San Francisco this last month a friend and I stayed at The Argonaut on Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel was absolutely spectacular from the helpful and attentive hotel staff to the wonderful rooms and amenities. The hotel restaurant, The Blue Mermaid, was a real treat. The food was so delicious and reasonably priced too. My friend and I had so much fun on our trip and so much of it was because of the hotel and its lovely staff. I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends and family!
ID-1155	DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. It was disgusting. The rooms were filthy. We actually found hairs on our bedsheets and the tub had a ring around it that was overlooked by housekeeping. We were not able to park anywhere near our room and had to carry luggage quite far. We had hoped to be able to spend time on the beach but there was a surfing competition on the beach directly outside the hotel and we ended up hundreds of yards down the beach. It was very difficult with small children. Because the rooms have kitchenettes we had hoped to eat a meal or two in our room daily but the layout of the kitchen was not at all functional. The internet service was extremely slow when we were able to get on at all. We will not be back.
ID-1039	I was attending a convention in Midtown New York and decided to book my stay at the Grand Hyatt New York due to other positive experiences I have had at Hyatt hotels. Sadly, this hotel was a huge disappointment. Upon entering the lobby, there is a fountain which is not well maintained and the water has a musty, damp smell which not only permeated the lobby but it aggravated me allergies as well. The accommodations were nice, but the service was terrible. At check-in, I requested a wake up call for the next morning which I never received. I ordered room service breakfast which took almost an hour to arrive and the food was cold. They offered to send up another breakfast but I did not have another hour to wait, so I sent it back. At check-out, the line was incredibly long and moved very slowly. When it was finally my turn, I noticed the breakfast charge on my bill and the cashier did not have the authority to remove it. I asked to speak to a manager, but after 15 minutes she had not arrived and I had a flight to catch, so I just ended up paying for the breakfast I never ate. In the future if I go to New York for business, I will definitely be staying at a small, boutique-style hotel that provides excellent customer service versus an old, out of date hotel like this one.
ID-1215	I am not impressed with this hotel. The location is terrible; it was loud all night because it is right off of a main street. There was no wireless internet in the rooms; you have to walk down to the lobby. The price is too high. The room was of average quality, I do not feel that I should pay $100 a night for an average room. At that price I expect something more. There were not many TV channels which made killing time in this small town after business hours a drag.
ID-0962	The location and free shuttle to the airport were incredibly convenient. The staff were knowledgeable of the area and very helpful to give me discounted tickets to events happening in San Francisco. The kids enjoyed the heated pool, while I enjoyed the free wi-fi throughout the hotel. The 24-hour on-site restaurant offers delicious meals for anytime of day.
ID-0892	What a great place to stay! Room sizes are just right and the freeway is right next door. To top it off the staff is so friendly and helpful.
ID-0854	I love the convenience of this hotel. It is right off the highway and very affordable. I have never had any problem securing a room.
ID-0976	The location of the Marriott on Queensway Drive in Long Beach is all around excellent. It is conveniently located near The Queen Mary, the luxurious Beaches, and the convention center. The hotel is located on the water front making for a spectacular view. After you're done with work or play there are many dinning and shopping venues close by. This place is great when you are visiting down town Long Beach!
ID-1241	Sometimes you can really tell when a hotel is trying too hard, but not being very smart about it. The Luxor has great ideas, but that's really all they are. There was a lot of surface flash in the design. However, when it came to actually providing a comfortable experience it failed. In particular, building a hotel at an angle is just not a very good idea. I kept getting vertigo every time I looked out the window or used the elevator.
ID-1135	I am very disappointed with the Centennial. First off, it is way too expensive compared to other hotels in the area, and you could get a room for so much cheaper with chain hotels nearby. The rooms were comparable to a middle-of-the-line hotel chain rooms, and weren't even that roomy! The attendants didn't even take a second glance at us, and overall, I would much rather stay at a different hotel with comparable service and MUCH CHEAPER rates than at the Centennial.
ID-1069	Did not like the food and the noise level around my room. I also did not like the room service, which got my order wrong twice. In addition i didn't get any treats after my check out. Did not experience the night life of being in NYC because my hotel room was hard to find, due to millions of people going in and out of the hotel. I give it a 3 out of 5.
ID-0972	This place may boast of vintage quality, but with rooms as small as these, one might as well rest in their vehicles to have a more comfortable time. Some of the rooms boast antique tubs alone. However, there is no shower option for these rooms, since only select baths have had them installed.   While the attempt to maintain a Victorian setting is quaint, some of the quality was threadbare and tattered. A broken window and blinds that hardly kept the light from bedrooms make for a night of restlessness that was amplified by an odd banging on the pipes throughout the hours.  This place is far too overpriced for what they boast, and the lack of amenities one might fight at a higher quality hotel makes for a waste of time and money.
ID-1125	My stay at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Minneapolis, MN was NOT an enjoyable experience. The hotel bills itself as a fancy, upscale place to stay in the Twin Cities, but in my experience it is anything but.   There is not free wireless provided by the hotel--to use the wireless you must either pay the hotel or be an AT&T customer. In this day and age where you can practically walk down the street and find a wireless signal, this is unacceptable.   Upon entering my room I found crumbs on the floor; clearly housekeeping had either not been there or not done a very complete job. Again, I expect better.   The hotel boasts about it's Manager's Reception at night and a Cooked to Order breakfast in the morning, but both of these were disappointing. The Manager's Reception featured some stale popcorn and ho-hum drinks, while I cannot speak as to the quality of the breakfast, as the line to participate in it stretched more than 25 people long. I was not willing to wait a half an hour of more to get my breakfast, as I had to leave far before that time.   Overall, the Embassy Suites was a disappointing experience. For the money I paid, I expected--and deserved--far better.
ID-1243	I received a discount coupon from one of my friend and when I went to the hotel they said it's not legitimate coupon. I was very shocked by that since it was from legitimate source. Anyway, we decided to pay the full price since hotel looked good and I had heard good things about it. As soon as I entered the room there were stains on the carpet and bedsheet wasn't changed from last customers who stayed in the room. Called the staff to report it but no one picked up the call. I would never visit it again.
ID-0870	We stayed at the Days in on 39th in Brooklyn for about 5 days in December. My daughter needed to find a place to live and register for school. This was the cheapest hotel we could find in Brooklyn. We thought it would be really bad but it was actually clean and pleasant. The staff were very helpful when we needed to get a cab. There was a free buffet breakfast. It was edible and the coffee was great. For the money I give it five stars.
ID-1273	This hotel is clean, but it is so huge that you feel like it takes forever to get from one place to the next. They need more elevators. The pool area is very loud and full of kids. Do not stay here if you plan on relaxing, it won't happen! I will never stay here again.
ID-0874	The La Quinta Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale FL is a great place to stay when your in Ft. Lauderdale! They are within driving distance to most attractions and right in the middle of Ft. Lauderdale. Resteraunt on site can bring you food as early or as late as you wish. Updated rooms and a nice pool to enjoy as well. Staff was friendly and helpful as well. I would definetly recommend the La Quinta in Ft. Lauderdale for your next stay at a hotel.
ID-0942	All I can say is WOW, what a great hotel! I had to pick a place to stay overnight and I picked to stay at this Super8 that I had just passed on my drive through PA. I checked in and was immediately greeted with smiling faces, and the consierge took my bag to my room and didn't even want a tip! The breakfast the next morning was amazing, and the view was great! I'm going to recommend this hotel to all of my friends.
ID-1002	The place was really nice, it was pretty inexpensive so I assumed it wouldn't be all that great but the rooms were clean and the staff was very helpful. If we go back to San Diego I will definitely use the same Holiday Inn Express.
ID-1051	I made a reservation at the Key West Marriott Beachside hotel, thinking it would be in the main part of Key West - but it wasn't. It wasn't even within walking distance, which made me feel like I was out of the main vibe of the city. The rooms were kinda sterile and way overpriced for what you get. The restaurant was good, but it was also very pricey. The drinks at the outdoor bar were watered down and also expensive. The private beach was tiny and barely had room to spread out a towel and lay on the sand. They had boat rentals right there, but we had to pay a fortune for renting them just for an hour. The service was okay, but not worth the price of the whole stay.
ID-1223	What a Joke! I stayed here on a buisness trip that my company sent me on. First off, it was at a mall so the parking was horrible and it felt like you had no privacy. The hotel staff was nosy asking what i came down to their town for. They seemed too chatty and was not all professional. I would have liked to stay at a real hotel with real suites and a staff that treated their guests like royalty. Do not stay at this hotel!
ID-1022	The Portsmouth Holiday Inn was the idea place to stay during our weekend visit to Portsmouth. We loved the indoor heated pool, and took advantage of room service to enjoy several breakfasts in our room. We also appreciated the free WiFi.
ID-1189	At America's Best Value Inn-Golden Gate, you get what you pay for. Sure, it's a great deal but is that really worth a dirty room, small closet, no coffee pot in your room and a small, dingy bathroom? Their complimentary breakfast is coffee and a muffin at the coffee shop next door. There is only one choice of muffin, too. It's really not that hard to have a simple couple of choices with breakfast. The front desk staff is rude and careless, they seem annoyed whenever you speak to them and look at you like you're stupid when you ask a question. There is a parking lot, but it is small, and the only way to get up to your room is a risky looking elevator or lots and lots of stairs. All in all, a horrible stay.
ID-1213	This hotel had no luggage carts available so you carried your luggage from the car to the hotel room. You had to hunt down the staff for any extra linens you may need also. Rooms are not as they apear in the picture. The pool if it is running will be available for limited hours only. The traffic noise outside will be a sure way for you to loose a good nights sleep. Don't expect any refreshments like a coffee bar here. Oh they have one but they run out of coffee before you get a cup. Donut's for breakfast here are right in line with box donuts you buy in the store. Save your money and go to a hotel that offers more service, quite atomsphere and quality care!
ID-1123	The ocean Creek Resort in Myrtle Beach is a dump. They advertise that they have several pools but they dont tell you they are packed wall to wall. I was expecting the hotel to be on the ocean but when I got there it was situated on a little creek!The staff was not very informative and the rooms were extremely small.The ocean side bar that they mention turned to be a little shack that served mainly beer and wine only!
ID-0814	The Hotel was great!! I loved the great view outside. The food was delicious, especially the potatoes and the creamy skim milk. The Hotel was fancy and neat! I recommend this to anyone who wants a perfect view of the Niagara Falls.
ID-1191	This hotel was the worst! After mixing up our reservations, we were put in a small room with a view of the parking lot. There must have been a wedding going on that night, because the hotel was packed with party-goers. What's worse is that someone decided to keep the party going in his hotel room, and they kept us up all night! And when we called the front desk, they were less than helpful. Definitely don't stay here!
ID-1177	Once I got to the Hyatt Regency, no one greeted me at the door. I had to bring my own bags in out of the car, and once I did find someone to help me, they seemed to have an attitude. I did manage to get the key to my room, however, once in the room... I didn't have a view of the Inner Harbor, like the online picture showed me that I would. I also wasn't able to leave my room and go to the dining room, because they were spraying for rodents. I wish I would have booked my stay at another hotel.
ID-0816	This is one of the better deals on the strip. Not only are they located directly on the strip across from MGM and Mandalay Bay but they have better prices, even on the weekends. We stayed Friday- Sunday and loved our experience. We went to the check in counter a little early and the woman behind the counter said we could check-in early if a room was available. I really wanted to stay in the pyramid so we could ride the elevators that go diagonally in the pyramid. She said there was a room and we could check-in early! The room was nice with a queen size bed a view of the strip. We dropped off our stuff and made our way into the casino. It looked like the casino had one of every game table open. We first hit the buffet, which offered a lot of variety and we left stuffed. We purchased the full day wristband for the buffet and returned later that night for dinner. Even though we were only there 3 days there was a lot to do at the Luxor. We not only played table games but walked along the shops that connected to Mandalay Bay. They have a walk-through of the Titanic museum which was neat to see all of the artifacts. The next time I go to Vegas I will probably stay at the Luxor again. With such good rates and a location right on the strip I don't think I could find a better deal.
ID-0952	This hotel was a really affordable and conveniently located to the highway where I needed to go i the morning. The room was on par with how much I paid for it. There was a little bit of noise but it wasn't the hotels fault just some noisy kids. In the morning they had a complementary breakfast that was actually really good!
ID-1253	I recently spent time at the Sandals Grande St. Lucian with my wife. The experience we had, was definitely not a good one. First off, our room wasn't ready when we got there and we had to sit in the humid lobby area while we waited. Every time, we visited the main pool it was overcrowded. The beach was filled with peddlers trying to sell you necklaces and other things, which really took away from the relaxing atmosphere that there was supposed to be. We will be staying elsewhere on our next visit.
ID-0978	This hotel was a nice place to spend a night. The room was spacious, and the beds were comfortable. All of the other guests were very quiet. The hotel was able to accomodate several rooms for our family during our family reunion. It was conveniently located near restaurants and a bank with an ATM. It was nice to have restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is not that far from an outlet mall that is a very popular place to shop. It is also not far from Portland.
ID-1259	Do yourself a favor and do not reserve a room at Club Quarters in Philadelphia. It is miles away from the train station, hard to get to, in the middle of a busy, noisy street (forget about a good night sleep)- and so impersonal. You have to use a computer to check in and out- not a real breathing body to welcome you to the hotel. The room was ok- a bit small, and the television was not much larger than my laptop screen- so much for watching tv in bed. If you are looking for quality, comfort, convenience and superior customer service, take a pass on this place.
ID-1103	We stayed here this winter and were extremely disappointed. The service was slow and the hotel is old and dated. The rooms look like they needed to be updated. The bedding was outdated and the mattresses were not comfortable. There was not much to do at the resort other than go to the small pool or ride bikes. The beach was really far away. The restaurants were expensive and not worth the money. We probably will not return.
ID-1203	On paper, this hotel is amazing. In truth, I would classify it as Just OK. Every feature seemed to have a downside, or some reason we could not use it.  The room has a bathtub, but the faucet to fill it doesn't work. The room has an office desk, but you have to practically sit on the bed to use it, because there's no room between it and the bed. The hotel offers huge TVs, but the HD service is non-existent.  They offer a bus to take you to the metro station, but the bus is always 20 minutes late. They offer a breakfast, but it isn't free.  Once I arrived, it seemed like they had set the entire place up as a trap. They lured me in with awesome features and then dashed my hopes with poor execution. Overall, I didn't HATE it, but it was only memorable for its disappointments.
ID-1183	The set up of this resort is ridiculous. It’s a pain to have our hotel room separate from the casino. We don't want to drive between both places so we have to rely on the transportation of the hotel. Even though the ride is free, you still have to wait for the bus to come and pick you up. The room was nice, but because it is located away from the casino it is very quiet... eerie quiet. We left the T.V. on all night just to have white noise while we slept. We wanted to go to the lobby to check out local events posted but the walk to the lobby is long, so we jumped in our car to drive to the lobby. Guests shouldn't have to drive from their hotel room to speak to someone in the lobby. I don't think I will stay here again. It's not worth all the moving around to do the same stuff at a regular hotel and casino.
ID-0808	I had a really good time while saying at the Adam's Mark Buffalo. The staff was very courteous and made me feel really welcome. The facility was clean and well decorated. The food in the restaurant was amazing and came out promptly. I am overall very satisfied with my stay.
ID-0966	I was on a trip to San Diego and most hotels were booked that weekend. Luckily, La Quinta had an opening. The place was nice and comfortable. The rate was reasonable and there's a decent Mexican restaurant right next door and some more restaurants within 5 minutes. The pool was clean and the hot tub working. Can't ask for more than that.
ID-0864	La Quinta was a great experience for me and my family. We checked in with no fuss, had our wifi running, took a dip in the pool, and our rooms were spotless. The temperature inside was PERFECT! Our beds were extremely comfortable too! Overall I had a great time at this hotel.
ID-1169	When passing through Vegas, I stayed at the Luxor for 1 night. I didn't have the experience I was hoping for. This was my first time at the hotel and when checking in I asked the front desk lady about show times and a few questions about the hotel buffets and she had to ask 4 other people before I got an answer. She knew nothing about the hotel. I was also told that the Luxor was in the middle of the strip, when booking and it is very clearly NOT in the middle but towards the end. My room was decent for 1 night stay, but I wouldn't recommend the hotel to anyone nor would I stay more than 1 night.
ID-0886	My husband and I took our two young children to Disneyland over the summer and we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel. The kids loved the Disney theme throughout the hotel! Our room must have been a princess theme judging by the wallpaper.   I liked being able to take the tram from the hotel to the park, with 2 little ones transport can be difficult. It was also great getting early admission to the park in the morning since the kids crash around 8 at night. This convenience and added perk alone was enough to justify the cost per night for me.   We will definitely be staying at the Disney Hotel next time too.
ID-1217	La Quinta Inn and Suites is a low end national lodging chain that is best to avoid for the business professional. While La Quinta offers rooms at an affordable rate, the sleepless nights make it way too expensive. The rooms are reasonably nice, but the general construction of La Quinta facilities includes walls so thin that you can hear your neighbor clear their throat. Additionally, the chain is a hotspot for families on vacation, so that means kids and animals lending to the disruption. And while there is a pool, it is often so cold that it is unbearable to enjoy. The staff don't exactly go out of their way for their client either. Is a restful sleep is desired, drive on past La Quinta.
ID-1095	Unless you care only about getting a low price and are not looking to have a pleasant stay, avoid this hotel. The staff is rude, impatient and impersonal, the rooms are poorly kept and the the food is extremely mediocre. The supplies you are given also seem pretty obviously to be bargain-bin junk. In fact, this place would be better classified as lodging than a hotel. The location however is relatively good, but there are much better hotels to consider.
ID-0796	This hotel was astonishing. It was decorated with the utmost of delicacy. From the lobby to indoor pool everything was perfect. The dining was a treat. Everything was cooked to perfection. The menu had a beautiful selection to choose from. The rooms were very decadent. The beds were extremely comfortable and I had more pillows than I knew what to do with. The jacuzzi tub was the icing on the cake. It had some of the best jets possible. It got rid of any kinks I had from my 6 hour flight. Overall my experience was pleasant. Everything from the staff to my stay was perfect!!!
ID-0882	The Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, located in downtown Scranton, Pa is a beautiful hotel located in an early 1900's train station. The hotel boasts beautiful stained glass ceilings and architecture that is hard to find anywhere else. The food is exceptional, with buffet style lunches with great selections for reasonable prices. The weekend brunches are hard to avoid! The staff are highly trained and consistent in dealing with consumers. The rooms are white-glove tested clean, with the highest level of attention paid to customer satisfaction. I highly recommend this hotel.
ID-0852	This was a beautiful and quaint hotel that I would describe as luxuriously rustic. It is nestled in the foothills and each room is like a little cabin. A custom wooden sign with your name on it is pieced together and hangs from the front of each cabin. It makes the stay feel so welcoming. We stayed in a room with a fireplace and a lovely four poster bed. The hotel allows dogs which is a wonderful feature and makes it all the more cozy. Each room is different and we have stayed in 4 different ones. Each room was elegant and interesting. It was always a surprise to see which one we'd get. It is a very romantic place to stay and the restaurants are top notch. It's really a perfect weekend getaway or a great place to spend an anniversary.
ID-1026	The Inn At The Convention Center is conveniently located near major freeways and is only minutes from hip downtown Portland. As well, The Inn is just a few blocks away from the Rose Garden Arena and - as its name implies - the Convention Center. Also, if you have some shopping to do, just a few blocks down the road is the attractive, multilevel shopping complex, the Lloyd Center. We are located near several restaurants, provide free room service, have free Wi-fi in every room, and are happy to serve you in whatever way we can. If you are just staying for one night on a business trip or if you need a longer stay, The Inn At The Convention Center will provide you with what you need for a private, restful hotel experience that is beyond compare in this area. Please call our friendly staff if you have any questions. We look forward to serving you!
ID-0898	All of the rooms at the Lemon Tree Hotel are 2 room suites! All of rooms have windows facing the lush garden common area and open up to the garden and common area. King size beds feature high thread count sheets, soft pillows, and high fashion coverlets.  The kitchen areas include a 4-burner stove, oven, and full size fridge. pots, pans, and a dish service for 6 is included in each rooms' kitchen.   The complimentary toiletries are imported from Italy and have a pleasant blood orange aroma. The rooms are decorate in shabby spanish chic,and each room features a wall mounted flat screen tv.  Free continental breakfast is provided each morning from 7-10am. Choices include cereal, assorted pastries, coffee, juice, and yogurt.
ID-0836	I visited Syracuse last winter to watch some college basketball and I chose this Econo Lodge because it was close to the Carrier Dome and was pretty cheap. Even though the hotel looks small from the outside, the lobby and especially the rooms were very spacious and clean. I asked the very friendly customer service at the front desk if they could give me a wake-up call the next morning and they were very accomodating.  My room was incredibly clean and it had kind of a Spring smell to it even though it was in the dead of winter. It was also very warm and toasty, and a very welcoming relief from the frigid cold outside. That night, I slept like a baby in the comfortable beds with very soft sheets, and I was woken up the next morning as promised by the wake-up call.  I couldn't have asked for a better stay for the extremely cheap price and it was made even better the next day when my team beat SU! I will definitely make this my hotel of choice the next time I visit Syracuse.
ID-0804	I would highly reccommend this hotel for many reasons. Nestled in the woods, right off of highway 299, The Big Foot Motel is a major attraction. There is a cage which once captured Big Foot which serves as a great photo opportunity. The rooms are quaint and cozy, with cute curtains on the window. The showers are warm and the staff is friendly. If I am ever in the area again, I will return without a doubt!
ID-1113	The first thing I noticed was how forceful the valet was to take my keys as I drove up to the hotel. I was waiting for someone to help me with my bags and had to stand in line to check in because there was only one attendant on staff. After being told that my room was accidentally booked before I arrived, I was told the only room available was a queen instead of the two double beds I asked for. The room was okay and the bathroom was impressive but unnecessarily large. In fact, they could have made the bathroom half the size and made the room bigger for more comfort. I didn't like having to pay $9.99 to park my car under the hotel but there was no street parking available anywhere else. My room faced the pool and that was a problem because of the noise with kids playing in it. Internet was charged in the room and for how much I paid a night, I thought it should come free. Overall, I was underwhelmed by the experience I had here for the price I paid to stay.
ID-1105	I took a trip to New York for a couple of days with my two daughters and we decided to splurge and stay at the Doubletree in Times Square. We booked a small suite on a mid level floor and were very excited to see our room but when we entered we discovered how boring and unimaginitive the decor was lacking in color and style. Everything was comfortable but the bathroom was old looking. We tried the exercize room too. Some of the equipment didn't work. Perhaps that's why we were the only people in it. The reception area was dull as well and the hotel staff were bored. I felt a little unwelcome and wondered if our jeans and tshirts looked too low brow for the place. Considering we spent well over $800, I think we got a bad deal.
ID-0920	I cannot recommend Days Inn enough. The young man who worked the front desk saw that we had a lot of bags since we were traveling with three young children. Once he gave us our keycard, he helped us carry our bags to our room. The rooms were nice and tidy and even smelled like they'd just been cleaned by a professional company who knew what they were doing. They inn where we stayed had free wireless internet which was definitely a plus and in the morning there was a free breakfast. Days Inn is a keeper.
ID-1037	My stay at the Aquarius was like a nightmare! First, lets start with the parking. I have a boat, as do most people who come to Laughlin. The Aquarius boat parking lot is WAY too small to accomodate boat parking - they have a 6 level parking garage for regular cars/trucks, and a lot the size of a postage stamp for boats! Anyway, after spending 45 minutes trying to get my boat into the tight spot, I have to lug my suitcases myself all the way from the lot in 110 degree heat and across the entire casino because they made the registration desk at the other end of the building, farthest from the parking. Then I wait another 30 minutes in a line, because they only have one person working, to finally get my room. When I get there, there must be a family of 20 in the room next to mine letting their kids go crazy or unsupervisized. We finally get to shower - in tepid water - and go down to eat dinner only to find the buffet is closed for the night -at 10PM!!! When we check out the next morning, I find that my boat has been scraped up by someone trying to get their boat out! Their security people are rude and just point out signs that we park at our own risk and the hotel has no responsibility for damages. What kind of hotel, particularly in Laughlin where boating is the main attration, doesn't provide suuitable boat parking?!?! I expected much, much more from the Aquarius. Their lack of customer consideration, and lack of planning for customer needs, has really tainted my thinking about staying there again.
ID-0948	Stayed for business for 4 nights. The rooms were very large, very spacious. I like that there was an actual door between the sleeping area and the living area. The pool was open late which was great because all of the kids were gone.
ID-1257	Upon arrival to this hotel with my family the staff seemed annoyed at the hyper nature of my dogs. I was not informed until arrival that the cost to have a pet there is $25 PER pet, PER night. This should have been told to me over the phone. Also, the room was not very clean; it seemed as if it had not been vacuumed after the previous person stayed there as there was pet hair all over the room. I will most likely NOT be staying there again.
ID-1237	I'm a big fan of the Westin brand, but I'll never stay at the downtown Denver Westin every again! It took over 30 minutes to get checked during a normal Monday afternoon, no convention no special events; just understaffed.   Once I got my room the tv didn't work, the coffee maker was busted. When I called the front desk to ask for repairs the treatment I received from the desk clerk was shocking and inexcusable. She hung up on me, twice! I finally had to go down to the front desk and speak with the manager on duty to get my issues addressed.  Finally when I checked out it took 45 minutes to get an $1,100 error corrected. My room was charged for function held by my company's marketing department. Not only did I have to call American Express to get the charge address the desk staff was rude and insulting.   I'll never stay at this Westin property again.
ID-0800	I recently stayed at that Astor Crowne Plaza in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Let me just say - WOW! The French Quarter is such a great experience and this hotel has the old, classic charm that you would expect from the area! Very elaborate and ornate decorations and beautiful staircases! One might expect that the rooms would be a little run down in such an old hotel, but no, these rooms were just as beautiful as the rest of the hotel! I asked the front desk if there was an area for me to enjoy a cigar outside without having to stand on the street, and she let me in on the balcony secret! The hotel has a huge private balcony that is alway empty and offers GREAT views of Bourbon street! It's a great way to experience Bourbon Street without having to be in the middle of it!  I ordered room service from the hotel for breakfast one morning and got so much food! They definitely don't want you to go hungry! As far as other meals went for me, I was in walking distance to Cafe Du Monde, Napoleon House, Pat O'Briens and several great oyster places!   I will be returning to New Orleans very shortly and I most definitely plan to call Astor Crown Plaza for my stay.
ID-1008	I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Aliante Station Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. What a fantastic hotel! We were treated to a scenic drive through Las Vegas on the way to our hotel. Once we arrived, we went upstairs to check out our room. It was beautiful! We had a fantastic view of the Red Rock Mountains. The bathtub was luxuriously large and the bubble bath mix they provided smelled divine. The beds were soft and cozy. The decor was very tasteful and reminded me of being in a spa. My husband and I enjoyed gambling downstairs. The slots were relatively loose and we won quite a bit considering we hardly spent any money. We absolutely loved dining at the variety of restaurants located inside the casino. They have Mexican, American, German and Italian food, plus several other types of cuisines. Everywhere we went, we were greeted with attentive service and delicious food. I especially enjoyed dining at Cabo, the hotel's Mexican restaurant. There is a bar in the center that features a massive chandelier made of bottles. The margaritas were strong and inexpensive. The gaming attendants we met while gambling were very friendly and didn't mind explaining the rules to us when we weren't sure how each game worked. I am so thankful that Aliante Station employs people who love their job! I am already looking into booking my next stay and can't wait to return.
ID-0958	My girlfriend and I decided to stay here given the proximity from downtown Philly where we were visiting. We booked via phone and the booking person kindly advised us that they are doing some minor construction in the lobby but that there are rooms available and distractions and noise should be minor. the receptionist greeted us and checked us in quickly. the facility was clean, and within driving distance to downtown Philly so we really enjoyed our stay. We noted that certain rooms were left open because they were doing construction but our room was locked and secure when we entered. Overall they are doing a good job of retaining customers while renovation is underway. The decor of our rooms was very good and checkout was not a problem.
ID-1171	The Vallarta palace is isolated from the rest of Mexico. Although it is located in a nice coastal area, staying at this resort isolates you from the interior of Mexico. Staying here will not show you what it's like to be in the heart of Puerto Vallarta city. The tourist store located inside the resort is incredibly expensive, with prices inflated at almost 150-175% of their actual value in the united states. For example, spray on sun screen costs seventeen dollars and fifteen cents. The bars located nearby seem geared to rip off unsuspecting tourists who do not seem to understand the conversion between currencies.
ID-1147	This hotel was horrible. We arrived at 10pm after looking everywhere for an indoor pool, only to find out we could only swim for 20 minutes! Since we were paying 100 bucks for the room, you would think they could have let us swim a little longer!? The room was small for a suite, and it was very cold. We couldnt get it warmed up. Smoking is nasty, and there was an ashtray right at the front door of the hotel, so every time we left we had to smell smoke. Waffles were the only hot food for breakfast. 100 dollar room and all I can get is waffles??
ID-0904	The design and the full description from the website was accurate in person. Loved the scenery, food, workers, and the vibe around the hotel. One of the best service i seen in a long time.
ID-1089	The Holiday Inn Express in Pueblo, CO was a horrible experience. The breakfast is free, but if you do not get down there fast enough it is gone. The front desk did not like his job. He was rude. The gym has hardly any equipment. The indoor pool was too dirt and cold. The Holiday Inn Express should invest some money into some new beds because they were horrible. I will never stay at a Holiday Inn Express again due to this one stay.
ID-1079	This place is horrible!! When I went to check in, they took at least 5 minutes standing around before they decided to pay attention to me, and were rude when they did! I was guaranteed a non smoking room, but when I opened the door, it smelled like one giant ash tray! Horrible! Not many activites for adults if you don't like to golf, which I don't. Room service was barely adequate, had to tell the dumb lady who barely spoke English to go away four times. I will NOT be returning.
ID-1201	Staying at the Bon Aire was for sure a waste of time and money. The rooms were disgusting, the service was terrible, and the bar was open all night! I could not sleep one single night due to all of the drunken parties going on outside of my hotel room. Not only was the hotel itself a complete let down, the beachfront was completely and utterly a total disappointment. The sand was completely full of broken shells and dead fish. Vacation is supposed a time to get away for a while and let go and have fun, not be angry and disgusted with every little thing that you had to pay for. If anybody is looking for a place to stay on St. Pete Beach, I would not recommend staying at the Bon Aire.
ID-0912	Stepping in Caesars Palace is like walking into a piece of history. There's both the iconic imagery of Rome, and the history of the hotel in Vegas for one to dwell on. It's a stunning combination that can get even better on really starting to get into the experience. The more one walks around the area, the more easily they slip into really feeling like being there is an experience. It's not just a hotel to sleep in, but rather one to experience as a big event.
ID-1020	This hotel provided me with an amazing night. Even though I arrived a tiny bit early, they were able to accommodate me and get me into my room immediately. The room itself was clean and comfortable. When I had a question about where I needed to go that evening to find a good place to eat, the staff was more than helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody that wanted a nice hotel to find on Mount Pleasant.
ID-0988	Ao Chalong hotel is an oasis in the middle of the Phuket paradise. It is near all of the little towns at the southern tip of the Phuket area. The staff is friendly and helpful and will go above and beyond to make you comfortable. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. It is beautifully furnished and the two pools outside are amazing. Plus the hotel is located on the Ao Chalong bay and has direct access to the water. You feel like you are staying in a tropical paradise here. We also enjoyed a lovely buffet breakfast in the mornings, with wide selections and fresh fruits!
ID-1016	The historic Mayfair Hotel is a great hotel to stay at. It looks a little dingy from the outside, but inside it is very elegant looking. My kids enjoyed sitting in the plush waiting room chairs while I checked us in. The elevator up to our room was noiseless and quick. The room we received was very nice. Everything was in its place and my kids enjoyed the view onto the street. We had their continental breakfast the next morning and everything was perfect, just like the breakfast I would cook at home for my kids. Will recommend this hotel to others and my family and friends.
ID-1028	The wagon wheel motel is quality lodging for affordable pricing. They may not look like much, but offer all amenities such as: microwave, tv, fridge, laundry, and coffee makers. They also offer weekly and monthly rates. Visit their motel and come see the historic wooden castle. Great, fun place, meant for all ages. Pet friendly.
ID-1159	Howard Johnson hotels are the biggest waste of time and money anyone could ask for. The rooms are so small that we had to rent another room to fit everyone in. As far as pets are concerned, you cant control how other people take care of them. That said once we came back home from our vacation, my dog was covered in fleas. I was completely dissatisfied with the staff of the hotel, they were very short and rude with my family. I am raising children and don't want them to think that is the right way to treat people but you can only shield your children for so long. This hotel didn't have great things for kids to do either. Once my children saw the indoor pool they were all over it. To my dismay as a parent never once did I see a lifeguard at the pool, which is very worrisome to me. The only time I would allow my children to go swimming was when I did, as I didn't trust them going there without supervision. The complimentary breakfast was a joke. They put out two trays of danish and a pot of coffee for the entire amount of guests it was very disproportionate. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone unless I really didn't like the person.
ID-0856	The Motel at 58th Avenue and I-25 in Denver is very nice place to stay and very convenient to downtown and the northern suburbs. Check-in was fast and hassle free.   Once I got to my room it was clean, fresh and furnished in classic western decor. They had extended cable access on a 42 flat panel LED TV. The wifi access was free and fast.  The morning buffet was hot and cooked to order.
ID-1157	We stayed at the Hilton hotel at the virginia beach oceanfront for a short weekend vacation. When we arrived at the hotel we waited at the check in counter for almost 15 minutes before someone helped us. Very poor service considering there weren't many people at the hotel to begin with. Once we checked in we went to our room but found that the elevator was not working so we had to carry our heavy bags up the stairs. This was horrible and no one even offered to help us with our bags all the way up to the 8th floor. When we got to our room we found it to be dirty and very outdated. There were a number of stains in the carpet and one of our lights over the bed didnt even work. The toilet in the bathroom kept running and we had to call maintenance 2 times to get it fixed. We had dinner at the restaurant that was located in the hotel and were very disappointed. The food was very overpriced and when we did get our food it was mostly cold and not very good at all. I would not recommend that any of my friends stay here, and overall we were very disappointed in our stay.
ID-1006	You will absolutely love staying at the Long Bay Resort. We have both an indoor and outdoor pool area for visitors joining us at anytime of the year. Families are welcomed, the childrens pool will have your young ones occupied for hours. Both adults and kids can enjoy the relaxing atmosphere of our lazy river. All of our ocean front hotels provide a view that you will remeber for years to come. Enjoy waking up to the soothing sound of the ocean waves. Our rooms are spacious and come with either one king size for couples or two queens for families. Come out and join us, we guarantee a unforgettable vacation!
ID-0964	My wife and I decided to stay at this hotel in the Noth Shore of Minnesota for a romantic getaway. The staff was so friendly that it gave a new meaning to Minnesota nice. Our room had a wonderful view of Lake Superior, and their restaurant had the best food I have had in the region. It was conveniently located off of Highway 61 so it was really easy to find. I plan to come back soon for our next anniversary. Can't wait for it!
ID-1247	I stayed at the Rennaissance hotel in Fort Lauderdale in October 2011. While the hotel was beautiful, I was nickled and dimed every time I turned around. For example, there was one price for the continental breakfast, and another price if you wanted a bit more food. For such an expensive hotel, I'm really shocked they couldn't have a simple, free, continental buffet. Or at least price the food comparable to market ratets.  Room service was prompt, tasty, and efficient but pricey, plus fees.  Furthermore the cost for using the internet was astronomical, and daily. I didn't even bother to try. Meanwhile a small cafe in a nearby plaza was offering free internet to its patrons.   Maybe this is a feature of more upscale hotels. Everything is lovely but be sure you're going to pay for it.
ID-1205	The Wynn hotel was not all that is was supposed to be for our Las Vegas trip. For the price and rating you would think that the rooms were not be as stark and just plain dull as they were. The location was ok. I have stayed at three star hotels that were better located. The sport book was very small and my husband actually went to another hotel's sport book. The Wynn hotel really lacked the character and theme that you would expect a five star hotel to have in Las vegas.
ID-1045	This place is too expensive. Our room overlooked a roof. We could see the ocean from one small corner of our window. We had a balcony, but it wasn't pleasant looking at the roof below. The restaurant was overpriced. Since the hotel is so isolated on the north side of the island, it requires some driving to get to another hotel. The hotel seemed crowded, and at times it was difficult to find staff to help us with information. Since most visitors are from out of state, it seems like the concierge would be more helpful in providing information about the area and about excursions. The pool was nice, but there were some questionable looking people around the hot tub. I don't know if this place was worth the money we paid.
ID-0934	For a cheap hotel, this place delivers. It's very convenient - located in downtown Montreal, close to a metro station as well as the city's central bus terminal. The staff is friendly and they serve great food, especially at their small but well-maintained restaurant. Their rooms are more than passable, with comfortable beds and despite being located in a busy area, not noticeably noisy. The wristbands they make you wear to prove you're a guest are kind of annoying, but a minor hassle outweighed by the benefits.
ID-0858	It had a great view of the water, it was close to many shops, nice swimming pool and a huge deck.
ID-1059	This hotel was horrible. I didn't get any fresh towels for hours after I called down to the front desk to ask for them. The comforter of the bed had an old stain on it and the toilet was broken. No one came to fix that. We called down to change rooms and they were disrespectful and they sounded annoyed, like we were the ones inconveniencing them. DON'T stay here!
ID-0996	We stayed at the Hotel Vintage Plaza for an anniversary a few months ago. I have to say, this is probably one of the most beautiful hotels we've visited. We were greeted warmly when we arrived, the staff was incredibly courteous and friendly. The check in process was quick and very simple, a welcome treat when we were tired from our travels. We took advantage of the valet services while we were there, and while it was an added expense, we felt it was well worth it to not have to worry about finding a place to park.   We stayed in one of their Garden Spa rooms, and I must say it's simply incredible. There are only three of these rooms, high above the city below. We walked into the room and were amazed at how spacious it was. While the room itself was gorgeous and very well appointed, what drew us to this room was the cedar deck with a hot tub. There is a lattice fence around the tub for privacy, and it was simply wonderful to soak away the stress of a hectic day of travel. While we didn't try their restaurant or spa services, we knew those were available to us as well, had we wanted a meal or a massage. Even more amazing, there are spa services available to you in your room, if you so choose. We were tempted to have an in room massage, but time simply didn't permit it.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for a relaxing, romantic getaway.
ID-1139	This hotel is located in downtown Richmond which is nothing short of a ghetto. The outside, while attractive, does not hold the modern flair I expect in a hotel. The inside of the hotel makes it seem like they tried to hard to reflect earlier times and I had a hard time finding the room. The layout of the hotel is confusing and the room was old and musty smelling. The staff are also impolite, the restaurant is overly expensive (especially for a beer) and the food was not as good as other restaurants we ate at in the area. The hotel was overpriced, but there are better options in Richmond from what I understand after doing my research. Beware.
ID-1129	When I decided that it was time for a long overdue vacation, I decided to do it somewhere small and laid back. That place was Charleston, SC. Since it had been a while since I had been on vacation, I did a lot of research beforehand. The choices had been between Savannah, GA and Charleston, SC. Since I live in GA, I figured that I could at least leave the state, and when comparing hotels, the pricing for Planters Inn (my ultimate destination) and its accommodations, (as displayed on its website) ended up winning me over. I guess what they say is right, you get what you pay for. Upon arriving to the hotel, it took forever to figure out the parking area and where to pull up to get assistance from the bellhop. There was no real designated area. I ended up having to call the hotel from my cell phone to have them send out someone for assistance. I figure it was just a minor inconvenience and brushed it off. Checking in at the front desk was fine, the young lady that greeted me was friendly enough and I was escorted to the elevator, which was in the process of having its system changed from an old fashion key entry to the key card swipe. I had several problems with this system on my stay, having to go get help from the front desk just to get back to my room several times. I'm an easy going person, by nature, so I didn't let this get to me, but it is still in the back of my mind that this is supposed to be a LUXURY hotel, these little things shouldn't be a problem. Once I make it to my room, on my first night, I figure it is time to settle in. It had been a relatively long drive, for one person, and I wanted to unwind in the big jacuzzi that their website promotes. First of all, finding a suitable temperature for the water was a pain. Warm would go to scorching with just a slight turn of the knob. Eventually I settled on mixing scorching with cold to get the desired temperature. Once in the tub, I realized the jacuzzi jets weren't as strong as I anticipated. They were quite weak actually. Another thing I brushed off because at that point I just didn't care. Once out, I decided to try this 4-star restaurant experience that they boast about and ordered the greasiest, slimiest little glob of foie gras I've ever seen or tasted. To this day, I'm still not sure if it was actually foie gras I was eating. Or attempted to eat. Thankfully I was able to order something else from one of the nearby restaurants. I would like to say that my trip got better over time, but it didn't. I tried the over-priced 4-star restaurant a couple of more times, but in the end ate elsewhere the majority of the trip. The location ended up being great for shopping, and I still say that the staff was pretty OK. I just don't think that I will be returning to the Planters Inn any time soon.
ID-1127	Worst experience. You can't even see the lake from the small tower. The front desk is rude and they appear to just want your money. You always have to go to the desk to get new towels because their room service is so slow. The rooms in the small tower are old and out-dated and do not have a mini fridge nor a microwave. They also allow dogs, so if you are lucky, you may get stuck next to someone's annoying pooch. The buffet food is not great either.
ID-1018	I stayed at the Super 8 in East Lansing. Even though I booked a room on short notice, the room was easy to reserve, and was ready when I arrived. The walk up to the room had a good view of the city, and was pretty quiet for being next to a highway. The hotel room had everything I needed, and plenty of space to put my luggage. Checking out was fast and easy. I would go there again.
ID-0980	Stepping into the Chicago Hilton I was immediately awed by the immaculate structures and cleanliness of everything around me. Despite the line of people standing to be checked in there was no chaos and everyone seemed to be checking in quite smoothly. People were walking away from the check-in line smiling and I have to say that I felt the same way. The girl behind the counter was a perky and pleasant lady that made me honestly feel welcomed to the Chicago Hilton.  Our room was spacious considering we ended up going with one of the cheapest rooms in the hotels and the bed was one of the most comfortable things I had ever slept on. I nearly unpacked my bags and curled up just to take a nap, but we still had all of Chicago to see!  After a long day of walking we came back to the hotel and decided to order room service. Our feet were aching and it was time to rest.   What a delicious array of items on their menus, and all at a price that was reasonable. The food was of restaurant quality and the room service was speedy and pleasant. I would swear they trained their employees to all give that perfect smile of welcoming, and if so I wish more places would do just that.  The next morning, before we were to check out, we made a stop at the swimming pool. While I swam in the spacious pool I thought of how I would have loved to have stayed at this hotel for more than just one night. With all of the amenities they have to offer I would have enjoyed being able to take advantage of just a few more. Alas, it will have to wait until the next time. And there will be a next time.
ID-1231	i recently visited The W Hotel in downtown New Orleans and even though this place is considered to be on the upper end of hotels...im gonna have to dicagree. Everything that glitters aint gold and there is nothing golden about this place. First of all, I AM NOT A TOURIST! I live in this city. I do not own a luxury vehicle. When i arrived to have my average-looking vehicle valet'd, the guys working there turned there nose up at me and didnt even offer me any of that free expensive water they gave out-of-towners. That was complaint #1. The check-in girl was ok even though the prices were through the roof. My room was nice but i refused to even look at the snack bar becuase the price of those snacks were way overpriced. i ordered room service and recieved it fast but the food was not fresh and seemed microwaved. I requested a wake-up call that night for the next morning but never received it. When i complained at the checkout the girl told me they were really busy with out-of-towner's checking in for a convention in the CBD and forgot. I guess every guest isnt treated the same. I received my vehicle and hurried up and got the hell away from there. To sum it up, this hotel may be a favorite downtown but it seems like tourist get better service than folks who live in town. i give this hotel two thumbs down. :(
ID-0944	The Holiday Inn in Rosslyn is a cheap hotel in a great location. There is a great view of the Potomac River, it is a block away from a metro station, and a short walk to Georgetown. It is also convenient to Reagan National Airport. The hotel also has free wifi and a restaurant/bar on the top floor that offers amazing views of Washington.
ID-1209	I was in the region on business trip. When I arrived at front desk, there were no available staff and had to wait about 10 minutes to check in. I asked for first floor room away from busy streets but that was not available. Inside, it was very average in terms of cleanliness and had a long-unused smell - not the caliber I expected from a brand like Ramada. My experience was very mediocre. I switched to the Best Western across the street the next night and that place felt much nicer.
ID-0998	Nice Clean Motel!Friendly service. We serve breakfast. Outside Pool for the warm days. Close to interstate. Have flea markets within minutes from motel.. Restaurants within walking distance. Prices are best around!
ID-1187	I stayed here a couple of months ago when I needed place to rest from driving all day long. When I went up to the front desk, the staff ignored me and when I finally managed to get his attention, he was rude. I was displeased with his attitude and bought the cheapest room there was. I was trying to go up to my room and then I bumped in to these crazy high school kids that were making a ruckus in the hotel lounge. (It was 11PM just so you know) I couldn't believe that the staff would just let these kids just run everywhere throwing chaos. When I got up to my room and looked inside, well let's just say it's not the cleanest room I've ever seen in my life. But what else do you expect from a hotel that has bad service and has kids running around at 11PM? I fell asleep as soon as I hit the bed and woke up and left. The check out staff was friendly but that was the best thing about this hotel. Will NOT be coming back to this hotel and won't be recommending any I know to do so as well.
ID-0896	I dont understand But That motel SO great i could just spend every weekend in it...
ID-0902	The Inn at El Goucho was the perfect way to stay in one of the trendiest areas of downtown Seattle, just a couple of blocks from the great music clubs where we could hear the newest Indie bands from Seattle. The rooms were spacious and the lounge has a fireplace, with snacks and fruit-infused water available all day. The restaurant downstairs serves the best steaks I've ever had, and there is an awesome small old-fashioned movie theater underneath the hotel, where we had drinks and appetizers before settling in for a cozy movie viewing. Just a few blocks away is the famous Pikes Place Market, with the flying fish stand that is shown in all the postcards. We didn't need our car at all the whole time. There was even valet parking, so we didn't have to worry about parking even if we had wanted to drive around - which we didn't. Everything was right there at this hotel. I would definitely stay there again.
ID-1199	There is a reason the rate is so reasonable for the Extended Stay America in Burbank. For a hotel of this size, we only saw one person working there, and it felt like we were in the middle of nowhere. It's not an area that is practical for pedestrians, and the room itself was not impressive. The kitchen area was very basic and there was some water leaking from the refrigerator.
ID-1143	If you are a smoker And you request a smoking room it is going to smell horrible! They are normally a decent rate but during special seasons when people from Canada come down they jack the prices up to 5 star hotel rates! Which can last for months! Rooms did not have microwaves or refrigerators!
ID-0982	When was the last time you visited the Courtyard Waukegan? Give it another try! With an all-new updated lobby and meeting areas, it's a great place to meet your other traveling colleagues for breakfast (serving Starbucks coffee) or for a drink after dinner (the Market is open 24 hours). Screens in the lobby welcome you with weather and news updates and the friendly staff at the front desk will remember your needs. The location of this hotel close to many businesses is convenient and there are plenty of restaurants, bars and shopping areas nearby. With balconies and a nice courtyard, there are a lot of places to relax and unwind. There is an indoor pool and exercise room so you can keep up with your needs on the road. Parking is free and plentiful around the hotel. The hotel provides a free shuttle (7am-5pm) to nearby businesses.
ID-1107	I would not recommend the Red Roof Inn! The beds were unclean. I requested maid service and found that they did not even change the bed covers but changed the sheets. There were not enough towels and front desk did not answer its phone! This hotel did not abide by following through with the noise ordinance. The staff was not helpful and the front office was disorganized.
ID-0880	If you are looking for a clean, convenient and comfortable place to stay in Grand Junction look no further! This hotel offers spacious and newly renovated rooms at a reasonable nightly rate. The lobby is large and gracious and served a free breakfast for guests each morning. It is conveniently located near downtown Grand Junction with easy access to convention centers, restaurants and all the shopping the city has to offer.
ID-1049	The Seaview Resort has really diminished over the years. I've been to this hotel many times since it's opened and over the past few years it's really gotten terrible. The staff were incredibly flighty and distant as well as cold. When I went to check in, they couldn't find my reservation so I had to wait over two hours to check in! Also, the beds had not been turned down and there was no soap in the shower. I was really disappointed with the service, overall. I felt like I was cheated out of my money and I should have just gone to stay in a hotel in Atlantic City.
ID-1195	I have always liked and will always like the Red Roof Inn! The management and associate staff were very friendly and courteous when helping my elderly parents and me find our hotel room. In addition, they gave us a discounted rate because we had competitor coupons! How awesome is that!? In addition, their hotel rooms are so affordable and somewhat remind me of my own home. I love the old-fashioned paintings they have in each room and the beds are AMAZINGLY comfortable. And they even offer breakfast! The good kind of breakfast too, not that processed crap you find at Super 8 or other hotel / motel chains.  I slept extremely sound when I stayed there; neither my family nor I had any complaints about the noise level. Come to think of it, I have nothing but positive reviews for this Toledo Red Roof Inn location! I love it and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for an economic hotel in the Toledo area!
ID-1227	My time at the Huntley Hotel could not have been more stressful. I arrived at the hotel only to find that my reservation had been lost and I would have to pay for a larger room. The staff was unsympathetic and unhelpful throughout the process. When I finally settled into my room, I was kept awake for most of the night by music and noise from the building's restaurant and bar. I spent the rest of my trip feeling exhausted and irritated.
ID-1251	I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff were rude and unhelpful and the hotel was dated. In addition to the dated decor, the property appeared to be very dirty and did not make me feel comfortable staying there. The continental breakfast was disappointing and the location was not nearly as great as they advertised on the website. The front desk forgot about my wake up call and didn't even apologize or offer any consolation about the fact that I was then running late. Terrible service - do not stay at this hotel.
ID-0822	This hotel was a great price near the Universal entrance. It's walking distance so you can save a lot of money on parking. You can also take a break from the parks and then head back out to City Walk for dinner or a movie during the evening. There is a pool to relax at if you want to take it easy after a long day in the parks. The staff were friendly. The area seems safe and it was very quiet at night even thought it is close to the interstate. I would recommend this hotel.
ID-1211	The Doubletree isn't the worst place I've ever stayed (it doesn't, that I've noticed, have bedbugs), but you should be forewarned about a few of its more unusual features. First, the hotel appears to have been constructed bit by bit, and has an unusual hub-and-spoke layout. If you stay in the hub, no problem. But if you stay in the spokes? You not only get a miniscule room, but you have to walk a really long ways to get to the main building, including crossing the parking lot and walking up and down stairs or elevators. It may not actually be a mile from the farthest rooms to the reception desk, but it sure feels like it.
ID-0810	Great 3 star hotel in the Austin area. They are centralized in the city and are greatly assist visitors with anything they need. They got us a taxi cab and the conossiour show us the happening places around town. The pool area was marvelous, thanks to the beautiful austin weather. The rooms were comfy and everyone was nice. Onsite parking was a huge plus.
ID-1109	The hotel was restricted in various areas. I did go when they were remodeling so there was sections of the hotel that was blocked off. They said it was because they were expanding the hotel. It would have been nice to know that they were remodeling when I made the reservation.  The food selection in the restaurant was on the higher priced side. The room has a bar size fridge and a small Microwave. It is important to bring your own food as there is no real reasonable transportation into town.
ID-1153	Stayed at the Marriott Fairfield Inn and Suites in downtown Louisville, Kentucky a few weekends ago. The hotel parking garage was difficult to actually enter because of the one-way streets in the downtown area and parking was extremely tight. The wait time was excessive to check in. We were told there was a youth sports team staying at the hotel and that they were booked solid. Room decor was average and I didn't like the wall locker they used for a closet - had to remove the ironing board in order to hang dresses and slacks. Complimentary breakfast was offered but not much was available by the time I walked down to eat at 8:30 a.m. For the money, my stay was a little lackluster. I think I'd try a different hotel if I travel again to the Louisville area.
ID-1271	I wanted to like this hotel when we walked in. The sitting area was a nice bonus, and it smelled very clean on entry. However, the TV was set up very poorly. It is right in between both rooms, making it awkward to watch from either the sofa or the beds. You also can't have it on when someone is sleeping as it disturbs them. I also didn't enjoy having to pay to park our car in the mostly empty parking garage. It seemed a rather over-the-top expense (and completely unclear on the website so we weren't expecting that).
ID-1091	I've stayed at the Park Hotel Tokyo and will probably never stay there again. For one, it's too far from everything. It's a ten minute walk to Shimbashi station (the nearest JR train station) and I almost got lost trying to find it. And to add to the inconvenience, when I tried to catch the train one morning, I got caught in the morning rush. Because it's a business district, I felt like a salmon swimming upstream just trying to get to the station!  Also, because it's a business district, there's not a lot to do nearby unless you walk a bit to get to Ginza, which is known to be one of the most expensive shopping district in the world. No thank you! There are a lot of restaurants in the area, but no shopping malls or arcades. I had to catch the train or subway to visit those kinds of places.  Then, the lobby of the hotel is on the 25th floor and there are almost no signs outside the hotel or near it to tell me where it is, so I had the hardest time finding it when I first arrived. And when I walked into the building, I thought I was in the wrong place because there are offices for the Kyodo News Agency from the 3rd floor (where I entered). Also, because it's on the 25th floor, it feels like I have to wait a lot to catch the elevators in the morning when I leave or the evening when I get back. And heaven forbid there's an emergency and I have to take the stairs down 25 floors!  I don't think I'll stay at the Park Hotel Tokyo again, and I'd recommend other travelers not to either, unless they enjoy getting lost. While it's certainly a nice hotel, it's too inconvenient and there are certainly cheaper places with more to do nearby.
ID-1030	We recently stayed at the Country Inn and Suites in Mishawaka, IN. The staff was very friendly and the location was convenient to everything in the area. The rooms were very spacious and they have an indoor pool. The price was also excellent for this area! I would highly recommend this hotel if you will be staying in the Mishawaka / South Bend area!
ID-1075	The Motel 6 Tropicana in Las Vegas is new remodeled, and the rooms are small! Actually, crammed would be a better word! The bathroom is huge, and I'm not sure why. They needed to make the sleeping area more spacious. They can put a twin bed in the bathroom with all the extra space in there. Also, the staff are very cheap about towels! I couldn't get one extra towel! If I ever stay there again, I'll be sure to pack my own towels! Plan on standing in line at check in. The staff is so pokey! I know I was on vacation, but I didn't plan on spending my whole trip standing in a line at check in.
ID-0860	This is probably the best hotel to stay at in all Savannah. It's right near the harbor on the western corner of the historic district, and within easy walking distance to the famous shops and restaurants right there on the river.   There are always many cultural events going on in that same area, too.  You can stroll St. Julian Street and see all the historic homes - not to mention the many, many churches that line the avenues in this district. Tours are available for many of the sites, too.   When the day comes to an end, you can return to your very large, luxurious room. The most comfortable I've ever found in any location! A scenic view from the windows, too.   And if you can't choose from the very many fine restaurants all about and within walking distance of Doubletree, don't worry - they have great food at their restaurants, which you can even have by room service.
ID-0924	It was late at night and I was just exhausted from a nights long drive when I saw a Motel 6 on the side of the road. I breathed a sigh of relief and thanked my lucky stars for its convenient location. The staff greeted me with a smile even though it was 4 o'clock in the morning and gave me a room that suited my preferences. When I got into my assigned room the decor was beautiful! The cleaning staff did an impressive job of keeping the room tidy and it was a joy to lay down and get a good night's rest at Motel 6. In the morning the muffins and coffee started me off great and it was even free! Furthermore there was a lot of great restaurants around the area and finding a good place to eat was no problem. The most convenient thing about motel 6 is their location and they always have friendly staff!
ID-0868	My hotel experience was great. The pool was nice and cool, the staff was so friendly and helpful, and the rates are unbeatable! Desk clerk assistance was willing to help me get ice at 4 AM. So very nice and understanding. I was in town for a wedding, and my brother in-law stayed at a Holiday Inn down the street; I still hear stories about how he wishes he had stayed at the America's Best Value Inn! Would recommend to anyone.
ID-1073	I had a layover on a flight in Philadephia, but I missed my connecting fight, so I had to stay in the nearest hotel that had an available room. The rooms were way over priced because there was a game that night...imagine that. I called to make a reservation at the airport, but by the time I got there, the professional customer service staff did not have my information and said all of the rooms had been filled. I asked them to check again and after about 10 minutes of watching them stare at the computer screen, they finally found one. The woman at the counter acted the entire time like I was an inconvinence and had a rude look and tone about her the whole time. I finally got my keys and went to my room, only to find out that the key wouldn't work. So I go back to the counter, and she says, What do you want now? I tell her my keys don't work, so she reprograms them and I eventually get into my room, which just happened to be almost 90 degrees in the middle of summer. Needless to say, I will never be staying at this hotel again.
ID-0984	Its more than a good nights sleep it is an experience. Warm and welcoming staff. Exceptionally clean rooms, with top of the line updated furniture and appliances.
ID-1131	This resort is terrible. The room service there was horrible and they steal your personal belongings. The room was super dirty and the sheets look like they had not been washed ever. There was nothing to do at the resort and the pools were dirty. I don't recommend this resort to anyone. Don't waste your money there.
ID-1267	The Riviera in Las Vegas is an awful place to stay if you're looking to enjoy yourself in Vegas. The staff is slow and seemed uncaring that the lines were nearly out the door. The options for food in the hotel were very limited, unless you like cheap ethnic food. The advertised Pin Ball Hall of Fame was actually just a few old machines randomly placed in a hallway. The smoking areas in the casino were not mapped out, and anytime you light a cigarette someone will chase you around asking you to move over, literally a few feet. If you're looking for a cheap, tacky, unfriendly place to go, the Riviera is it. I would not go here again.
ID-1000	Great place for the price. Beautiful location on the water, in the heart of St. Augustine beach. Clean rooms friendly staff. Beds were very comfortable. Can't wait to come back next summer.
ID-1269	This hotel is overpriced and the room I got did not have a good view even though I paid extra for a better view. All the shops and activities costs a lot more than others.
ID-1071	I stayed at the Microtel in Charlotte, NC 3 weeks ago and I will never make that mistake again. The rooms were small, the staff was disinterested and I swear I saw a bug lurking in the corner behind the toilet. Though the Microtel is only a short distance from the local airport, I spent most of the night trying to sleep while flights kept going by. Never again. 2 stars. Bottom line: The rooms may be cheap, but you get what you pay for.
ID-1067	When we stayed at the La Quinta in Brownsville nothing went right. The room seemed to be clean upon first glance but we later noticed a large amount of cut hair left over from the previous occupant in the bathroom trash bin. There was a coffee maker in the bathroom, which I thought was strange, and underneath the coffee bag they provided was a silverfish that I had to get my husband to squish. When we mentioned these things to the desk, they acted nonchalant and didnt offer a new room. The maids cleaned up everyday even when we had the do not disturb sign on the door. I dont mind when they fix the sheets but the maid went through our clothes and touched my things, including the case all my jewelry was in. I wouldnt stay here again.
ID-1041	Upon checking into this hotel and heading to our room, we were inconvenienced right off the bat when the handle of the toilet fell off. This meant a trip back down to the front desk and then having to re-pack and move to a different room.  After finally getting settled in, we went to the pool for a quick swim and to relax in the hot tub. The facilities were small, smelled heavily of chemicals, and had the smallest, itchiest towels. The worst was the main wall was one open window that faced the main hallway---which means that everyone coming and going gawked at us the entire time we were there.  The continental breakfast had your basics (juice, donuts, eggs, cereal), but the space was tiny. We ended up taking our breakfast up to our rooms because the same people were camped out there all morning. The hotel looks nice, but for the price the inconveniences were too much.
ID-0806	this hotel is very affordable and any one can come here and enjoy there self
ID-1225	I will never stay in another La Quinta Inn again! The pool was outside instead of inside, and the weather was too cool for that. After a long day of travel, we couldn't swim. There were 3 beds, if you include the pull out couch, but it was so cramped we could hardly walk around. There were only 2 towels, we had to go request more. I don't think it would be that hard to put at least 4 towels in the bathroom, it just seemed like no thought was put in to it. There was a coffee pot and coffee in the room, which I was looking forward to, but then I realized, there were only 2 packs of sugar and 2 packs of creamer. All of these may sound like little things, but to me they add up to a lack of care for the customer. La Quinta is all about the bottom line, not the customer.
ID-0946	This hotel is awesome, it doesn't have bugs, shitty walls, bad floors, and weak balconies. It doesnt have sex offenders living in the whole back building and it is very secure.
ID-1121	Horrible Hotel! I would not stay again. The bedding smelled weird. The marble floors were really slippery when it rained. We had to go outside, into a second building to get to our room. The computer room was tiny and cramped and HOT! Staying here ruined our vacation, I would not stay again!
ID-0884	The Jameson Inn is fantastic! The staff was extremely friendly. The hotel looked as though it had just been renovated and was extraordinarily clean. The value was incredible. The free continental breakfast was the best I have ever had in a hotel. From now on whenever I visit Lafayette I will definitely stay at the Jameson Inn.
ID-1265	The Beachcomber Resort & Villas leaves a lot to be desired! I had to wait 10 minutes for the valet to take my car, and another 15 min for them to find my name is the system. I had booked this room 3 weeks ago, mind you. After all that, the room must have had a quick turnover, because there were no towels, and a pillow was missing. At this point, I figured I would at least go to the beach, but it was packed to the brim. No problem I thought, I will use the hotels amenities. Nope! One pool was closed, and the other was a mess. Beachcomber is not worth the money; understaffed, and subpar amenities. This place did not meet my expectations.
ID-1167	Hotel Penn is a cheap hotel, and for good reason. Our bedsheets were stained, the paint is pealing, and the bathroom was disgusting. The bed was also very uncomfortable, and the TV was incredibly old-fashioned. The place smelled, and the cleaning staff was unhelpful. We had to wait in an incredibly long line to check in, and there was no free wifi.
ID-0866	This Day's Inn is very near the airport, which is the main reason we chose it. The street it is on has a lot of shops and places to eat, which made it convenient when we needed to go out. It isn't a fancy place, but it was comfortable and decent for what we paid. I appreciated that it was quiet, and the pool was empty every time we wanted to swim, which my kids loved.
ID-1081	I did not like this hotel. I could not see the ocean from my room, just a bunch of buildings. It was too expensive to eat in the hotel restaurant, and the room did not have wi-fi. I had to pay daily to connect to the internet with a cable. This is a huge hotel. There were many people coming and going all the time.
ID-0914	Our room was amazing! The views of the bay were so romantic off of our balcony, and the jacuzzi really set the mood for our honeymoon. The king size bed was super comfortable and it was so nice to stretch out in a huge bed for once. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was delicious, it was hard to believe it was really free. We've paid for breakfasts at other hotels and this was better! We'd definitely stay here again. The rooms are great and the price is right.
ID-1055	I had very high expectations for The Sorrento; sadly, this was quite a disappointment. The Fireside Room is nice, but service was spotty, and the novelty wore off after a few minutes. Unfortunately, the hotel itself can't match the elegance of the building's exterior. The rooms are very small. I felt I could barely walk to the front door without running into the furniture. The sofa and coffee table looked pretty run down. There was no view whatsoever, except for the alleyway behind the building. I didn't really get the book shelf with obscure novels: is this some kind of clever joke? At best, my experience at The Sorrento could be described as mediocre.
ID-0826	We stayed at the sandcastle resort/hotel in virginia beach for 3 days. When we arrived we were greeted by the front desk clerk and promptly checked in. When we got to our room we found that we were upgraded to an ocean view room and were also comped a continental breakfast in the morning. The room was clean and had a beautiful view. The staff was very nice and took care of our every need. When we checked out we were also given a coupon for a future stay for a free upgrade as well as 20 percent off on a weekend stay. Overall this hotel is very nice and has recently been updated. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and hope to return here again soon.
ID-1173	My husband and I spent a night at a Super 8 motel in N. Attleboro, MA, recently. All I could think of was the Bette Davis line: “What a dump!” It was run down and dirty, with cramped rooms and an unfriendly staff. Two of the lightbulbs in our room were burned out (although that was probably for the best, since we couldn’t see our threadbare bedspread and carpet as well as we would have otherwise!). Paper-thin walls meant little sleep, and the so-called “free breakfast” meant cold coffee and hard bagels. Never again!!!
ID-1101	This hotel was ridiculous priced and terrible. The whole place smelled like smoke and was just a place that people went to get off.
ID-0992	The Ste Marie Marie Antoinette Hotel, now renamed the Hotel Le Marais, is located in the heart of New Orleans, the famous French Quarter. Just steps away from all the sights and sounds of the Quarter, its location couldn't be more convenient. Its charming decor recalls earlier days of the Quarter, rich with history and atmosphere. The property houses a pool and restaurant/bar. The Ste Marie Marie Antoinette's rates are very competitive with other hotels in the area. Take a look at the hotel's brochure; see the value for yourself!
ID-0802	This hotel was great! The room was so big and spacious and we were very well taken care of. Great continental breakfast too! There was lots of variety to choose from. The staff was so friendly and accommodating and the price was right too! Check in and out were so quick and easy, we had no problems at all. We will definitely be coming back here again.
ID-0812	The Rio Hotel where everyroom is a suite is not just an ad! The rooms were HUGE! The best room for the price we ever had. The decor was classic. The only hotel we stayed in Vegas that actually used a water saving shower... a big plus. In terms of food the Rio had everything. Starbuck, a snack shop. The buffet had the best seafood with live pound and half and more lobster. The room service was very very reasonable.  The location is just off the strip but there is a shuttle that leaves every thirty minutes that we used to go to the center of the strip.  The service at the Rio, shuttles included, really gave us a Welcome To Vegas feeling. A great stay!
ID-1235	i absolutely hated my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn located at 1755 S Waterman Ave, San Bernardino, California. the staff was horribly rude and not helpful. They lost my luggage and then charged me a fee for having them find it despite it wasn't my fault for them losing it. The housekeeping failed to close my door so my laptop was stolen. the feather pillows were cheap and rancid, the feathers poked me all night long. the So called light and noise blocking curtains were anything but. I heard people in the pool all night and morning and the sunlight still came in through the curtains and made the area warm and uncomfortable. The room service was lousy, they couldn't scramble eggs if all of humanity depended on it. Wifi barely worked in the room and their coin laundry took all of my tokens so I couldn't wash. their Pavillon Market was way too expensive, I've never paid $7.00 for one hungry man dinner ever. their fitness room consisted of one punching bag and two treadmills with three weights 5, 10 and 20 lbs.
ID-0928	Overall, this hotel was lovely. The room was of great quality, and was cleaned and well kept. The room service was also desirable in that they were prompt and kept the bathroom well stocked with fresh towels and toiletries. The complementary breakfast was delicious, and offered a wide variety of options. Furthermore, the wifi was a great addition to the overall package. The casino shuttle service was also a nice touch and very convenient for guests. Finally, the gym was packed full of equipment and convenient to use. The jacuzzi suites were truly spacious and comfortable as well.
ID-0818	This hotel is very clean, and has a respectful and pleasant staff. Great continental breakfast. When we called for extra towels we had them within two minutes. Great overall experience.
ID-0926	My last stay in Santa Barbara was my best mini vacation in recent memory primarily because my fiancé and I stayed at the Oceana. The hotel boasted a beautiful view of the pacific ocean, mere steps from our front door. The furnishings were quaint and cozy and imparted a serene sense of comfort to the love nest. The hustle of this ocean town was perfectly offset by the beauty and peace of our room at Oceana.
ID-1117	If you want to visit the place straight out of the “Twilight Zone, by all means visit the Hotel Galvez. This place looks like something from a bad fifties horror movie. Although they claim it has, I don’t think the décor has been redone since then and the smell, oh my god, like a dead grandma. My entire room and sheets were all infused with this musty smell. This hotel needs major air duct work or to find where Norman Bates is keeping his dead mom and get rid of her. Air the place out for god sakes, you charge $350.00 for a room! The Galvez is rumored to be haunted, but I think they need new plumbing, because the sound of the toilet in the room above me, flushing all night, kept me awake, and I would have welcomed the company of a ghost. We could have played cards or done something to keep me entertained, because this hotel rates one big snore for entertainment. Unless your sixty and packing a walker or in preschool and still taking naps, stay away from this place unless you want to be rendered semi-comatose by boredom. Finally, there are the cockroaches. Everyone in the south has a few of them, but the ones at the Galvez look like they’ve been taking steroids on the sly. I hit one with a shoe, and I swear he got up, shook himself and then came after me, with murder in his beady little eyes. In summation, stay away from the hotel Galvez, unless you want to star as the victim in a bad horror movie, asphyxiated by mold, bored to tears and/or get eaten by killer cockroaches.
ID-1057	This hotel was... I stayed there about a month back, and boy, did I have problems with it. Oh, the rooms were okay, but my big problem was the staff.  More to the point: the staff are really inarticulate. I had to bring family, so I asked them how much it was for two rooms next to each other; they said the cost for both. I learned when I went to check out that what they meant was the cost for each and I was paying double my expectation because someone at the desk was an inarticulate, uneducated boob.  What was otherwise an okay experience was just ruined by this one moment, and when you're paying twice as much for a multiple day stay, that's a pretty big moment. Don't go; there's a Super 8 across the street, and even though you get what you pay for, at least you'll actually know how much you're paying.
ID-1263	I recently stayed at the Aulani Resort and Spa and I must say that if you want a relaxing vacation away from yelling kids and screaming babies don't come to Aulani. The 6 in our party were between the ages of 25 and 30 and 95% of the time we had to deal with screaming children running around our legs while tired parents tried to corral them. The food here is beyond expensive where the character breakfast was ~$20 per person and dinners at the Ama'ama Restaurant averaged between $30-$50! The layout of the resort was nice but if you don't enjoy kids don't come here. In the pool there are always kids splashing around and causing a ruckus! The rooms are nice but you don't go to a Disney Resort to stay in the rooms!
ID-1149	The website is deceiving. They show a nice view of Atlanta from an fancy terrace that does not exist in actual fact. The room they stuck me in was small and way back in the corner of the fifth floor. It had a bed that was nice, but no room to really move around. I felt like a sardine in there. The biggest heart-break was that I was expecting an extra special hotel based in the pictures on the website. The neighborhood is not safe, especially at night with vagrants and bums running rampant. I was very disappointed.
ID-0872	What a beautiful and wonderful place to spend our honeymoon! The staff went beyond our wildest dreams to make sure the room was nice. The room was very clean, comfortable and nicely decorated with perfect New Orleans charm. The hotel is a few blocks from the French Quarter so perfect walking distance for a night out, yet not having to pay the high taxi fees to try to make it safely back to the hotel. There just isnt enough words to say how much we loved this hotel!
ID-1245	First let me start off by saying that I absolutely hated the Marriot at Union Square. Upon walking in the receptionist was rude and wouldn't get off the phone while I stood there waiting for my room key. They said they couldn't find my reservation and I had to wait in the lobby for about twenty minutes until finally the manager came and apologized saying there had been a mistake and had found my reservation and could go up to my room. After getting no help in carrying my luggage up to my room, I walked in and a faint smell of chemicals hit me. I'm not sure from what but maybe it was to mask some awful odor from a previous guest. Either way I opened the window to let the smell out and was hit by the obnoxious noises from the street below. So many cars and people made it impossible for there to be one second of peace and quiet. I was told that the location was wonderful but nobody ever told me that while trying to sleep I would be bombarded by all the honks and noise from the street below and that all the lights would seep through my window curtain... at 3 AM!! It was like trying to sleep in the middle of a rave. There were so many things wrong with the hotel but I can't list them all because I hate reliving my experience. I do NOT recommend this place.
ID-0832	The trump plaza is the trashiest hotel i have ever had the displeasure of staying in. We walked in to our room and there was glass on the floor. the floor. We got zero compensation for the fact that our room was clearly uncleaned, they almost made it seem like maybe we planted it there. The experience dampened the whole casino trip. Luckily we won some money or it would have been a ruinous weekend.
ID-0936	Ramada had the best customer service I have ever come in contact with involving a hotel! We were only going to stay for three nights while visiting relatives on a recent trip to Cordele, GA. After 3 days, we wanted another night just because we felt so pampered and taken care of in the room. This was an awesome place to stay at! I would recommend this place to anyone needing a room in the south.
ID-1047	The hotel was not what expected the people where very rude And the room cost,to much just to stay one night was too much money
ID-1099	I HATED my stay at Desert Inn with a fiery passion. It was dirty. Trash bins weren't taken out, new bathroom essentials (shampoo, soap, etc) weren't supplied, the cleaning lady refused to give me clean towels! The other guests were LOUDDD and obnoxious. I will never. ever. visit this hotel again.
ID-0894	If you need an inexpensive, convenient place to stay in the Charleston, South Carolina area, the Red Roof Inn in North Charleston is a great choice. First of all, it’s very convenient to many shopping centers, retail establishments, restaurant and the highway, so you can get almost anywhere you need to go in a short period of time. It’s also just a quick trip down the expressway from the beach and historic downtown Charleston, but you don’t have to pay the ridiculous fees some of the other hotels in the area charge. The staff is friendly and our room was always very clean, and the Wi-Fi connection was excellent. Everyone we met who worked there or stayed there was really friendly. Overall, it was a great hotel in a great location at a great price. What more could you want? We will definitely be staying there again in the future.
ID-1197	Booked this hotel because it was close to family that we were visiting in the Eugene/Springfield It was located off I-5 at a very busy intersection. It was difficult to get in and out of the driveway becsuse of the traffic. It was noisy at night due to the traffic. Breakfast consist of powder eggs, pancakes, precooked sausage and box store pastries. As my mother would say You get what you pay for. I did not pay alot!!!
ID-0970	Our stay at the Arizona Grand was awesome! Our room was spacious, the bed was comfy, and we even got a balcony to enjoy (great for drying the kids' swimsuits after a day at the included waterpark). It was nice to have a separate bedroom and living room, and the summer time events were great (movie at the water park, which was also on tv if you wanted to stay in). We even used the hotel pool a few times when we were just worn out from the park activities and wanted some quiet. And speaking of quiet, for as busy as the resort was on a holiday weekend, you would never know from how quiet it was in our rooms! The hotel is wonderfully clean and well-kept, and I felt very safe staying here with my children. I would definitely stay here again!
ID-1065	This hotel was run down and smelly. The no-smoking room was thick with cigarette smoke and strong chemical cleaning smells. The carpet had dark stains. The bedding was very uncomfortable. The entire bathroom was yellowed with age. I felt very uncomfortable sleeping there. I will never return.
ID-0906	Centrally located, this facility has everything and is nearby to everything. Excellent food in the sumptuous restaurant. Excellent communication with the outside world. A stay to remember. thanks, blf.
ID-0830	I stayed at this Days Inn over the weekend for a friend’s wedding. This is a great hotel. They had fresh continental breakfast in the morning. The room was neat, clean and had no residual smell. The bed was comfortable and I rested quite well. I needed a map of the city and directions to the hall where the wedding was held, the front desk clerk was more than helpful. He researched the internet for directions on Map Quest and printed them out for me. He provided this service with a smile.
ID-1115	While I was staying in the hotel there were few prank calls that was really scary. The carpets were not that clean and not so good laundry facility. Cramped elevators and not so good breakfast. Hotel rooms are expensive for the service that they offer.
ID-1193	Our stay at this hotel was not very pleasant. While the room was spacious it didn't appear to be very clean. Also, it was a bit pricey for the location and accomodations. While the stay came with a free breakfast, it was not very good. The food was bland. They also offered a business station with a computer and internet access. Unfortunately the computer was outdated and the business room smelled bad.
ID-1097	The Westin in Virginia Beach is a rip-off. For upwards of $120/night you can have an amazing view of a parking lot. Your only option is to valet your car, at $20-$25 per night, plus tips, and the rooms will make you claustrophobic. The rooms are sparse with not even a minifridge and the AC rattled all night. To save the environment, or better yet, their pockets, they turn the water pressure to the lowest possible setting in the shower. You have to specially request that they change your sheets, and I had to call several times to get the proper amount of towels in the bathroom. On top of that, there was hair all over the shower wall. Paper thin walls mean you will hear your neighbors go to the bathroom, watch TV, or talk. I will never be going back again.
ID-1087	If you wnat to stay some palce where it is sucha snobby place then this is the hotel for you. Very upscale and you feel like you cant rtelax while you are on vacation. they make you dress up collared shirt just to have dinner at a resort that is over by the beach!!!!
ID-1004	Come spend the night at this amazing property. Fresh smelling rooms, clean linen, sparkling pool are just a few to name. Our hotel staff is always friendly.
ID-0938	We were going from Miami to Key West and were too tired to drive all the way, so we decided to spend the night at Florida City. As it was a Saturday night, we were not sure about availability of rooms. But then we stopped at a tourist center and there was this hotel just behind it. It had 4 different wings so we were sure that we would get a room. We enquired the rates, which were pretty reasonable for that hotel so we checked in.   The hotel was rated as 2 stars. I have stayed at other two star hotels and was delighted to see a much better room this time. The hotel room was spacious, the furniture looked brand new. There was microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, air conditioner in the room. All the appliances were clean and looked very well maintained. The bed was super nice and we had a good night's sleep. The bathroom had room freshner and was in spotless condition. The soap and shampoo were of good quality. They even served breakfast. We chatted with the receptionist who was very helpful in telling us about local tourist spots. We went to everglades national park on her advice even though it was not on our itinerary. We saw many crocs and the detour was totally worth it. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.
